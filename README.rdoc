To use these generator templates I recommend adding this function to your bash profile.

  function railsapp {
    template=$1
    appname=$2
    shift 2
    rails $appname -m http://github.com/ryanb/rails-templates/raw/master/$template.rb $@
  }

You can then use this "railsapp" command instead of the traditional "rails" one. Simply pass the template name as the first argument:

  railsapp base store

That will generate a Rails app using the base.rb template found here.
